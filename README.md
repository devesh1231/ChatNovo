Real-Time Web Chat Application
Welcome to the README documentation for the Real-Time Web Chat Application! This application provides users with the ability to sign up, log in, edit their account details, and engage in real-time chat conversations with other users. Below, you'll find essential information about the current features, technologies used, and future enhancements planned for the application.

Features
The Real-Time Web Chat Application comes with a range of features to facilitate seamless communication and interaction:

Sign Up and Log In: New users can easily sign up with the application and existing users can securely log in.

Secure Login: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, ensuring the protection of user data.

Edit Account Details: Users have the flexibility to edit their account information, allowing them to keep their profiles up-to-date.

Delete Account: Users can choose to delete their accounts, providing a way to manage their presence on the platform.

Real-Time Chat: The application leverages the power of Socket.IO to enable real-time chat functionality, making conversations smooth and dynamic.

Chat History: Users can view their previous chat history, allowing them to catch up on conversations.

Message Character Limit: To encourage concise communication, there's a 250-character limit on messages.

Core Development Experience
During the development of this application, I gained valuable experience in various aspects of backend development. Some of the key areas I focused on include:

Node.js: The application is built using Node.js, providing a robust and scalable runtime environment.

REST API: I implemented a RESTful API using Express.js to handle user authentication, account management, and other interactions.

Database Management: The application utilizes databases to store user information and chat history, enhancing data organization.

Socket.IO: Web sockets powered by Socket.IO enable real-time communication, creating a dynamic chat experience.

Performance Optimization: I prioritized performance optimization to ensure the application runs smoothly and efficiently.

Planned Enhancements
In the future, I intend to expand the capabilities of the Real-Time Web Chat Application with the following features:

Administrator Accounts: Implementation of administrator accounts to manage user interactions and ensure a safe environment.

Multiple Chatrooms: Adding support for multiple chatrooms to facilitate discussions on various topics.

Username Updates in Logs: Updating usernames in chat logs to maintain accurate records of conversations.

Account Deletion in Logs: Ensuring that deleted accounts are properly reflected in chat logs.

Session Renewal: Implementing session renewal mechanisms for enhanced security and user convenience.
