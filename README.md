his real-time web chat application allows users to sign up, log in, edit their account, and chat with others.
It currently lets users:
👤 Sign up and log in
🔐 Secure login with bcrypt password hashing
✏️ Edit account details
🗑 Delete account
💬 Chat in real-time powered by Socket.IO
📜 View previous chat history
🔢 250 character limit on messages
I gained valuable backend development experience building this from scratch and implementing core chat functionality like:
#nodejs #restapi #expressjs #databases #socketio
Database managements
User authentication
Web sockets for real-time communication
Performance optimization
Features I'm looking to add:
👮♂️ Administrator accounts
🗣️ Multiple chatrooms
🔄 Update usernames in logs
❌ Delete accounts in logs
🔁 Session renewal
